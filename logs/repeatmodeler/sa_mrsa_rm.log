NAME
    RepeatModeler - Model repetitive DNA

SYNOPSIS
      RepeatModeler [-options] -database <XDF Database>

DESCRIPTION
    The options are:

    -h(elp)
        Detailed help

    -database
        The name of the sequence database to run an analysis on. This is the
        name that was provided to the BuildDatabase script using the "-name"
        option.

    -pa #
        Specify the number of parallel search jobs to run. RMBlast jobs will
        use 4 cores each and ABBlast jobs will use a single core each. i.e.
        on a machine with 12 cores and running with RMBlast you would use
        -pa 3 to fully utilize the machine.

    -recoverDir <Previous Output Directory>
        If a run fails in the middle of processing, it may be possible
        recover some results and continue where the previous run left off.
        Simply supply the output directory where the results of the failed
        run were saved and the program will attempt to recover and continue
        the run.

    -srand #
        Optionally set the seed of the random number generator to a known
        value before the batches are randomly selected ( using Fisher Yates
        Shuffling ). This is only useful if you need to reproduce the sample
        choice between runs. This should be an integer number.

    -LTRStruct
        Run the LTR structural discovery pipeline ( LTR_Harvest and
        LTR_retreiver ) and combine results with the RepeatScout/RECON
        pipeline. [optional]

    -genomeSampleSizeMax #
        Optionally change the maximum bp of the genome to sample in all
        rounds of RECON (default=243000000).

CONFIGURATION OVERRIDES
    -recon_dir <string>
        The path to the installation of the RECON de-novo repeatfinding

        higher )

    -ltr_retriever_dir <string>
        The path to the installation of the LTR_Retriever structural LTR
        analysis package.

    -rscout_dir <string>
        The path to the installation of the RepeatScout ( 1.0.6 or higher )
        de-novo repeatfinding program.

    -ninja_dir <string>
        The path to the installation of the Ninja phylogenetic analysis
        package.

    -genometools_dir <string>
        The path to the installation of the GenomeTools package.

    -abblast_dir <string>
        The path to the installation of the ABBLAST sequence alignment
        program.

    -cdhit_dir <string>
        The path to the installation of the CD-Hit sequence clustering
        package.

    -rmblast_dir <string>
        The path to the installation of the RMBLAST sequence alignment
        program.

    -repeatmasker_dir <string>
        The path to the installation of RepeatMasker.

    -ucsctools_dir <string>
        The path to the installation directory of the UCSC TwoBit Tools
        (twoBitToFa, faToTwoBit, twoBitInfo etc).

    -mafft_dir <string>
        The path to the installation of the MAFFT multiple alignment
        program.
