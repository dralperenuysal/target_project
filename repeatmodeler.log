Ready to start the sampling process.
INFO: The runtime of RepeatModeler heavily depends on the quality of the assembly
      and the repetitive content of the sequences.  It is not imperative
      that RepeatModeler completes all rounds in order to obtain useful
      results.  At the completion of each round, the files ( consensi.fa, and
      families.stk ) found in:
      /home/alperen/PycharmProjects/target_project/RM_88915.ThuFeb82214322024/ 
      will contain all results produced thus far. These files may be 
      manually copied and run through RepeatClassifier should the program
      be terminated early.
